## ✦ CVD/(ColorBlind)-friendly schemes

Colorschemes designed with color-vision deficient users in mind, by authors such as Paul Tol, Masataka Okabe, Kei Ito, and Martin Krzywinski.

## ✦ Flags

Colors extracted from flags of different countries and regions, downloaded from
[Flagpedia](https://flagpedia.net). Intended to represent these regions in
visualizations, but not necessarily effective. Many flags have similar
colorschemes. The flags are named according to the region's ISO3166 two-letter
abbreviation (often the same as top-level WWW domain), with any hyphens removed.
