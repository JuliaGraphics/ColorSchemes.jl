## ColorSchemes

_Final v2 release. The next release, v3, will move some of the tools to another package._

This package provides tools for working with colorschemes and colormaps. It provides many pre-made colormaps and schemes:

- scientifically devised colorschemes from ColorBrewer and CMOcean
- popular old favourites such as _viridis_, _inferno_, and _magma_ from MATPlotLib
- old masters' colorschemes, such as _leonardo_, _vermeer_, and _picasso_
- variously themed colorschemes such as _sunset_, _coffee_, _neon_, and _pearl_

In addition, you can extract colorschemes from images, and replace an image colorscheme with another.

*The package is designed for general purpose and informal graphics work. For high quality color maps that have consistent perceptual contrast over their full range, refer to Peter Kovesi's [PerceptualColourMaps](https://github.com/peterkovesi/PerceptualColourMaps.jl) package.*

This package relies on the [Colors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl), [Images.jl](https://github.com/JuliaImages/Images.jl), and [Clustering.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Clustering.jl) packages.
