## ColorSchemes

![big picture](docs/src/assets/figures/snapshot.png)

This package provides a collection of colorschemes and colormaps:

- scientifically devised colorschemes from ColorBrewer and CMOcean
- popular old favourites such as _viridis_, _inferno_, and _magma_ from MATPlotLib
- old masters' colorschemes, such as _leonardo_, _vermeer_, and _picasso_
- variously themed colorschemes such as _sunset_, _coffee_, _neon_, and _pearl_

*The package is designed for general purpose and informal graphics work. For high quality color maps that have consistent perceptual contrast over their full range, refer to Peter Kovesi's [PerceptualColourMaps](https://github.com/peterkovesi/PerceptualColourMaps.jl) package.*
