# Introduction to ColorSchemes
This package provides a collection of colorschemes:

- scientifically devised colorschemes from ColorBrewer, CMOcean, ScientificColorMaps, ColorCet, and Seaborn
- popular old favourites such as _viridis_, _inferno_, and _magma_ from MATPlotLib
- old masters' colorschemes, such as _leonardo_, _vermeer_, and _picasso_
- variously themed colorschemes such as _sunset_, _coffee_, _neon_, and _pearl_

Note that the schemes contained here are a mixture:

- some are high quality color maps with consistent perceptual contrast over their full range
- others are designed for general purpose and informal graphics work

Choose colorschemes with care! Refer to Peter Kovesi's [PerceptualColourMaps](https://github.com/peterkovesi/PerceptualColourMaps.jl) package, or to Fabio Crameri's [Scientific Colour Maps](http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php) for more information.


This package relies on the [Colors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl) package.
