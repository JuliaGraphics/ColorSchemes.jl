# Basics

## ColorScheme objects

When you start using ColorSchemes.jl, it loads a set of pre-defined ColorSchemes, and stores them in a dictionary called `colorschemes`.

A ColorScheme is a Julia object which contains:

- an array of colors (eg `RGB(0.1, 0.3, 0.4)`)
- a string defining a category
- a string that can contain descriptive notes

To access one of these built-in colorschemes, use its symbol:

```@example
using Colors, ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.leonardo
```

The display depends on your working environment. If you’re using a notebook or IDE environment, the colors in the colorscheme should appear as a swatch in a cell or in a Plots window. Otherwise, you’ll see the colors listed as RGB values:

```julia
32-element Array{RGB{Float64},1}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.0548203,0.016509,0.0193152)
 RGB{Float64}(0.0750816,0.0341102,0.0397083)
 RGB{Float64}(0.10885,0.0336675,0.0261204)
 RGB{Float64}(0.100251,0.0534243,0.0497594)
 ...
 RGB{Float64}(0.620187,0.522792,0.216707)
 RGB{Float64}(0.692905,0.56631,0.185515)
 RGB{Float64}(0.681411,0.58149,0.270391)
 RGB{Float64}(0.85004,0.540122,0.136212)
 RGB{Float64}(0.757552,0.633425,0.251451)
 RGB{Float64}(0.816472,0.697015,0.322421)
 RGB{Float64}(0.933027,0.665164,0.198652)
 RGB{Float64}(0.972441,0.790701,0.285136)
```

You can access the array of colors as:

```julia
ColorSchemes.leonardo.colors
```

By default, the colorschemes aren’t imported. To avoid using the prefixes, you can import the ones that you want:

```julia
julia> import ColorSchemes.leonardo
julia> leonardo
32-element Array{RGB{Float64},1}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.0548203,0.016509,0.0193152)
 RGB{Float64}(0.0750816,0.0341102,0.0397083)
 RGB{Float64}(0.10885,0.0336675,0.0261204)
 RGB{Float64}(0.100251,0.0534243,0.0497594)
 ...
 RGB{Float64}(0.757552,0.633425,0.251451)
 RGB{Float64}(0.816472,0.697015,0.322421)
 RGB{Float64}(0.933027,0.665164,0.198652)
 RGB{Float64}(0.972441,0.790701,0.285136)
```

You can reference a single value of a scheme:

```julia
leonardo[3]

-> RGB{Float64}(0.10884977211887092,0.033667530751245296,0.026120424375656533)
```

Or you can ‘sample’ the scheme at any point between 0 and 1 using `get` or `getindex`:

```julia
get(leonardo, 0.5)

-> RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)

leonardo[0.5]

-> RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)
```

```@docs
get
```

## The colorschemes dictionary

The ColorSchemes module automatically provides a number of predefined schemes. All the colorschemes are stored in an exported dictionary, called `colorschemes`.

```julia
colorschemes[:summer] |> show
    ColorScheme(
        ColorTypes.RGB{Float64}[
            RGB{Float64}(0.0,0.5,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.01,0.505,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.02,0.51,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.03,0.515,0.4),
            ...
            RGB{Float64}(1.0,1.0,0.4)],
       "matplotlib",
       "sampled color schemes, sequential linearly-increasing shades of green-yellow")
```

## Finding colorschemes

Use the [`findcolorscheme`](@ref) function to search through
the pre-defined colorschemes. The string you provide can
occur in the colorscheme’s name, in the category, or
(optionally) in the notes. It’s interpreted as a
case-insensitive regular expression.

```julia
julia> findcolorscheme("ice")

colorschemes containing "ice"

  seaborn_icefire_gradient
  seaborn_icefire_gradient  (notes) sequential, ice fire gradient...
  ice                 
  flag_is                   (notes) The flag of Iceland...
  botticelli          
  botticelli                (notes) palette from artist Sandro Bot...


 ...found 6 results for "ice"
```

The function returns a list of matching colorscheme names as symbols.

```@docs
findcolorscheme
```

If you prefer, you can ‘roll your own’ search.

```julia
[k for (k, v) in ColorSchemes.colorschemes if occursin(r"colorbrew"i, v.category)]
265-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :BuPu_6
 :Spectral_4
 :RdYlGn_5
 ⋮
 :BrBG_8
 :Oranges_4
```

## Make your own colorscheme

Using Colors.jl, you can quickly define a range of colors and use it to make a colorscheme:

```@example
using Colors, ColorSchemes
cs1 = ColorScheme(range(colorant"red", colorant"green", length=5))
```

```@example
using Colors, ColorSchemes
cs1 = ColorScheme(reverse(Colors.sequential_palette(300, 100, logscale=true)))
```

Or you can easily make your own by building an array:

```@example
using Colors, ColorSchemes
mygrays = ColorScheme([RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0])
```

Give it a category or some added notes if you want:

```julia
mygrays = ColorScheme([RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0],
    "my useful schemes", "just some dull grey shades")
```

although this scheme won’t end up in the `colorschemes` dictionary.

Another example, starting with a two-color scheme, then building a gradient from the first color to the other.

```julia
myscheme = ColorScheme([Colors.RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), Colors.RGB(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)],
               "custom", "twotone, red and green")
ColorScheme([get(myscheme, i) for i in 0.0:0.01:1.0])
```

Another way is to use `loadcolorscheme()` function:

```julia
using Colors
loadcolorscheme(:mygrays, [RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0],
     "useful schemes", "just some dull grey shades")
```

and that will be added (temporarily) to the built-in list.

```julia
julia> findcolorscheme("dull")

colorschemes containing "dull"

  mygrays               (notes) just some dull grey shades...


 ...found 1 result for "dull"
```

If you want to make more advanced ColorSchemes, use linear-segment dictionaries or indexed lists, and use functions to generate color values, see the `make_colorscheme()` function in the [ColorSchemeTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorSchemeTools.jl) package.

## For CVD (color-vision deficient or "color-blind:) users

This package contains a number of colorschemes that are designed to be helpful for people with some deficiencies in their perception of color:

- deuteranomaly (where green looks more red)

- protanomaly (where red looks more green and less bright)

- tritanomaly (difficult to tell the difference between blue and green, and between yellow and red)

- tritanopia (difficult to tell the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink)

```julia
findcolorscheme("cvd")

colorschemes containing "cvd"

  tol_light            (category) cvd
  tol_muted            (category) cvd
  tol_bright           (category) cvd
  okabe_ito            (category) cvd
  mk_8                 (category) cvd
  mk_12                (category) cvd
  mk_15                (category) cvd
```

### :tol_light
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.tol_light # hide
```

### :tol_muted
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.tol_muted # hide
```

### :tol_bright
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.tol_bright # hide
```

### :okabe_ito
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.okabe_ito # hide
```

### :mk_8
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.mk_8 # hide
```

### :mk_12
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.mk_12 # hide
```

### :mk_15
```@example
using ColorSchemes # hide
ColorSchemes.mk_15 # hide
```

Also, it's possible to generate schemes using `Colors.distinguishable_colors()`:

```@example
using Colors, ColorSchemes
ColorScheme(distinguishable_colors(10, transform=protanopic))
```

## Continuous color sampling

You can access the specific colors of a colorscheme by indexing (eg `leonardo[2]` or `leonardo[5:end]`). Or you can sample a ColorScheme at a point between 0.0 and 1.0 as if it were a continuous range of colors:

```julia
get(leonardo, 0.5)
```

returns

```julia
RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)
```

!["get example"](assets/figures/get-example.png)

The colors in the predefined ColorSchemes are usually sorted by LUV luminance, so this often makes sense.

You can use `get()` with index data in arrays to return arrays of colors:

```julia
julia> get(leonardo, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0])
3-element Array{RGB{Float64},1} with eltype ColorTypes.RGB{Float64}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.05482025926320272,0.016508952654741622,0.019315160361063788)
 RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)  
 RGB{Float64}(0.9724409077178674,0.7907008712807734,0.2851364857083522)
```

!["get example 2"](assets/figures/get-example-2.png)

```julia
julia> simg = get(leonardo, rand(10, 16));
julia> using FileIO
julia> save("mosaic.png", simg)
```

## Matplotlib compatibility

Most of the color schemes in Matplotlib are available. The following code example gives a general picture.

```@example
using ColorSchemes

# https://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html

   println("$(rpad(k, 12)) $(length(v))")
   for cs in v
      try
         c = ColorSchemes.colorschemes[cs]
      catch
         println("\t$(rpad(cs, 12)) not currently in stock")
      end
   end
end
```
