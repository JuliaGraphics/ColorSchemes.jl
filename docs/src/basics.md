# Basics

## ColorScheme objects

When you start using ColorSchemes.jl, it loads a set of pre-defined ColorSchemes, and stores them in a dictionary called `colorschemes`.

A ColorScheme is a Julia object which contains:

- an array of colors
- a string defining a category
- a string that can contain descriptive notes

To access one of these built-in colorschemes, use its symbol:

```
julia> ColorSchemes.leonardo
```

If you're using Juno, for example, the colors in the colorscheme should appear in the Plots window.

!["leo color scheme"](assets/figures/leo-colorscheme.png)

Otherwise, you'll see the colors listed as RGB values:

```
32-element Array{RGB{Float64},1}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.0548203,0.016509,0.0193152)
 RGB{Float64}(0.0750816,0.0341102,0.0397083)
 RGB{Float64}(0.10885,0.0336675,0.0261204)
 RGB{Float64}(0.100251,0.0534243,0.0497594)
 ...
 RGB{Float64}(0.620187,0.522792,0.216707)
 RGB{Float64}(0.692905,0.56631,0.185515)
 RGB{Float64}(0.681411,0.58149,0.270391)
 RGB{Float64}(0.85004,0.540122,0.136212)
 RGB{Float64}(0.757552,0.633425,0.251451)
 RGB{Float64}(0.816472,0.697015,0.322421)
 RGB{Float64}(0.933027,0.665164,0.198652)
 RGB{Float64}(0.972441,0.790701,0.285136)
```

You can access the array of colors as:

```
ColorSchemes.leonardo.colors
```

By default, the colorschemes aren't imported. But to avoid using the prefixes, you can import the ones that you want:

```
julia> import ColorSchemes.leonardo
julia> leonardo
32-element Array{RGB{Float64},1}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.0548203,0.016509,0.0193152)
 RGB{Float64}(0.0750816,0.0341102,0.0397083)
 RGB{Float64}(0.10885,0.0336675,0.0261204)
 RGB{Float64}(0.100251,0.0534243,0.0497594)
 ...
 RGB{Float64}(0.757552,0.633425,0.251451)
 RGB{Float64}(0.816472,0.697015,0.322421)
 RGB{Float64}(0.933027,0.665164,0.198652)
 RGB{Float64}(0.972441,0.790701,0.285136)
```

You can reference a single value of a scheme once it's loaded:

```
leonardo[3]

-> RGB{Float64}(0.10884977211887092,0.033667530751245296,0.026120424375656533)
```

Or you can 'sample' the scheme at any point between 0 and 1 using `get()`:

```
get(leonardo, 0.5)

-> RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)
```

```@docs
get
```

## The colorschemes dictionary

The ColorSchemes module automatically provides a number of predefined schemes. All the colorschemes are stored in an exported dictionary, called `colorschemes`.

```
colorschemes[:summer] |> show
    ColorScheme(
        ColorTypes.RGB{Float64}[
            RGB{Float64}(0.0,0.5,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.01,0.505,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.02,0.51,0.4),
            RGB{Float64}(0.03,0.515,0.4),
            ...
            RGB{Float64}(1.0,1.0,0.4)],
       "matplotlib",
       "sampled color schemes, sequential linearly-increasing shades of green-yellow")
```

## Pre-defined schemes

Each scheme is drawn in three ways: first, showing each defined color; next, a continuous blend obtained using `get()` with values ranging from 0 to 1 (stepping through the range `0:0.001:1`); and finally a luminance graph shows how the luminance of the scheme varies as the colors change.

_It's generally agreed (search the web for "Rainbow colormaps considered harmful") that you should choose colormaps with smooth linear luminance gradients._

!["general schemes"](assets/figures/colorschemes-general.png)

```@docs
colorschemes
```

To choose a random ColorScheme:

```
using Random
scheme = first(Random.shuffle!(collect(keys(colorschemes))))
```

## Finding colorschemes

Use the `findcolorscheme()` function to search through the pre-defined colorschemes. The string you provide can occur in the colorscheme's name, in the category, or in the notes. It's interpreted as a case-insensitive regular expression.

```
julia> findcolorscheme("magen")

colorschemes containing "magen"

spring               (notes) sampled color schemes, linearl...
cool                 (notes) sampled color schemes, linearl...

```

```
julia> findcolorscheme("cmocean")
colorschemes containing "cmocean"

```

If you prefer, you can 'roll your own' search.

```
[k for (k, v) in ColorSchemes.colorschemes if occursin(r"colorbrew"i, v.category)]
265-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :BuPu_6
 :Spectral_4
 :RdYlGn_5
 â‹®
 :BrBG_8
 :Oranges_4
```

## Make your own ColorScheme

You can easily make your own ColorScheme objects by building an array:

```
using Colors
grays = ColorScheme([RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0])
```

Give it a category or some added notes if you want:

```
grays = ColorScheme([RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0],
    "my useful schemes", "just some dull grey shades")
```

although this won't end up in the `colorschemes` dictionary.

Another example, starting with a two-color scheme, then building a gradient from the first color to the other.

```
myscheme = ColorScheme([Colors.RGB(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), Colors.RGB(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)],
               "custom", "twotone, red and green")
ColorScheme([get(myscheme, i) for i in 0.0:0.01:1.0])
```

Another way is to use `loadcolorscheme()` function:

```
loadcolorscheme(:mygrays, [RGB{Float64}(i, i, i) for i in 0:0.1:1.0],
     "useful schemes", "just some dull grey shades")
```

and that will be added (temporarily).

```
julia> findcolorscheme("dull")

colorschemes containing "dull"

mygrays              (notes) just some dull grey shades...


found 1 result for "dull"
```

If you want to make more advanced ColorSchemes, use linear-segment dictionaries or indexed lists, and use functions to generate color values, see the `make_colorscheme()` function in the [ColorSchemeTools.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorSchemeTools.jl) package.

## Continuous color sampling

You can access the specific colors of a colorscheme by indexing (eg `leonardo[2]` or `leonardo[5:end]`). Or you can sample a ColorScheme at a point between 0.0 and 1.0 as if it were a continuous range of colors:

```
get(leonardo, 0.5)
```

returns

```
RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)
```

!["get example"](assets/figures/get-example.png)

The colors in the predefined ColorSchemes are usually sorted by LUV luminance, so this often makes sense.

You can use `get()` with index data in arrays to return arrays of colors:

```
julia> get(leonardo, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0])
3-element Array{RGB{Float64},1} with eltype ColorTypes.RGB{Float64}:
 RGB{Float64}(0.05482025926320272,0.016508952654741622,0.019315160361063788)
 RGB{Float64}(0.42637271063618504,0.28028983973265065,0.11258024276603132)  
 RGB{Float64}(0.9724409077178674,0.7907008712807734,0.2851364857083522)
```

!["get example 2"](assets/figures/get-example-2.png)

```
julia> simg = get(leonardo, rand(10, 16));
julia> using FileIO
julia> save("mosaic.png", simg)
```

## Matplotlib compatibility

Most of the color schemes in Matplotlib are available. The following list gives a general picture.
